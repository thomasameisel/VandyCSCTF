## Walkthrough
Use Linux command <code>file</code> to check the type of the file. Then use the appropriate decompression tool to decompress the files until you get a text file that is the flag. For example, the first file is of type RAR so you can use the <code>unrar</code> tool (<code>unrar -x file1</code> on Linux) to decompress it and get the next file.
