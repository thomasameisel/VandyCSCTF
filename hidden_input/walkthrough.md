## Walkthrough
Entering a username and clicking submit on the page will bring you to a page that says that you must be admin to view the flag. Looking at the source code of the first page (right click anywhere then click View page source), you can see that there is a hidden checkbox called "is_admin". You can un-hide this checkbox by going into the Developer Console then Elements tab then right click on the line and select "Edit as HTML". You can now delete the "hidden" parameter from the checkbox input. You should now see the checkbox on the page, and checking this box then submitting the form will show the flag.
