## Walkthrough
If you change any of the options in the dropdown on the "View File" screen then select that option, you can see an error from Linux saying <code>Command failed: cat ./files/sfsdf cat: ./files/sfsdf: No such file or directory</code>. (You can change options in the dropdown by opening the Dev Tools then going to the Elements tab then right clicking on one of the "select" tags and selecting Edit as HTML.) This error gives you several pieces of useful information. You can tell that the server is returning the contents of the file by running a <code>cat</code> command on the system itself for the given file (it is not using some type of file system module). You can also tell what folder you're in (files). By changing an option to "; ls;" you can see all the files and folders in the project's root directory. There is an admin folder, so by changing an option to "; ls admin;" you can see that that folder has a "flag.txt" file in it. To view that file, you can change an option to "; cat admin/flag.txt;" or "../admin/flag.txt" and select that option.
