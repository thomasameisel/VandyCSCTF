## Walkthrough
Clicking through the site and looking at the URL, you can tell that the directories are shown using the name query parameter. For example, "/dir?name=/dir1/dir2" will show the "/dir1/dir2" directory. Whenever the client can change a query (like in a URL), there is often a chance for vulnerability. By changing the name query parameter to a random string, the error that is shown reveals that there is not much validation done on the server before listing the contents of the given directory. In order to go to other directories, you can change the name query parameter to "../" (the URL should look like "/dir?name=../"). This gives the public directory, which we consists of the code for the client-side of the website. If you go up another directory by changing the name query parameter to "../../" you can see that there is an admin folder. You can view the files in the admin folder by changing the name query parameter to "../../admin", which shows that there is a "flag.txt" file in that directory. Clicking on that file will display the flag.
