Done for now
- unzipper - unzip the file using multiple different compressions
- cookies - website that change the cookies in order to login using admin
- post to url - website that exposes the url that gets the flag, no authentication server side when posting to that url
- login in source - have username and password in the source code
- sql - sql injection to login
- robots - username and passwords in the robots.txt file
- javascript injection - use javascript injection with the child_process node package in order to view file system

Ideas
- php - website that saves a file using php, use php vulnerabilities to execute php that will show the flag
