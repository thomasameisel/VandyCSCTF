## Walkthrough
By looking at the onload function for the body of profile.html, you can see that it calls the loadText function in profile.js. This method gets an <code>auth</code> cookie and a <code>username</code> cookie then uses a GET request on <code>/v1/user/{username}</code> in order to display the text seen in the profile. In order to make the server think you are admin, you can either do a GET request on <code>/v1/user/admin</code> or change your <code>username</code> cookie to be <code>admin</code> and refresh the page.
