## Walkthrough
You can tell that the text is loaded from the getFlag function in validation.js from the index.html body onload parameter. The getFlag function sends a POST request with the browser's User Agent in the body. Since the response says that it must come from VandyCS browser, it is safe to assume that the User Agent must be "VandyCS" (there are multiple ways to change the User Agent). A refresh of the page will show the flag.
