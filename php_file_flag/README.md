## php file upload vulnerability

#### Run:
- index.php needs to be put on a random server
- `php -S localhost:8888`

#### Todo:
- Implement storage so it gets stored to ./uploads/filename.ext
- Add impossible flag when auth is set up for each challenge (for flag.txt)
- Restrict the upload by file's extension
