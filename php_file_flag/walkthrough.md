## Walkthrough
File uploads in PHP are very susceptible to vulnerabilities, especially if the programmer does not do any validation before allowing users to upload files. You can tell that the website is written in PHP because the path is <code>/index.php</code>. By attempting to upload a text file or other non-image file, you can tell that the website does not do any validation before uploading the file. This means that you can upload a PHP file then execute that PHP file on the server. PHP has a built-in function called <code>passthru</code> which executes its parameter on the system that it is running on. This means that if you upload the list.php file that is in this directory then right click on the broken image icon and open in a new tab, you can see the result of the <code>ls ../../</code> command executed on the server. From there you can see that there is a "flag.txt" file, and finally you can upload the sol.php file that is in this directory then right click on the broken image icon to see the flag.
