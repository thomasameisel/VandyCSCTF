## Walkthrough
The source code was provided for this challenge.

From the source code, you can tell that the form submission refreshes the page with a POST request with a "name" field retrieved from the name input in the form. Next, passthru is called with a parameter of "echo " and the value of the name field. The passthru function in PHP executes its input on the server. For example, <code>passthru("ls")</code> would list the contents of the directory where index.php is contained. Since the server is simply concatenating "echo " and the value of the name filed, if you set the name field to be "; ls ../;" the passthru function would list the contents of the directory one level up from where index.php is contained. This is because the server is calling <code>passthru("echo ; ls ../;")</code> and would therefore return the result of <code>ls ../</code> executed on the server. From this we can see that flag.txt is a file in that directory, so if you set the name field to be "; cat ../flag.txt", you will see the flag.
