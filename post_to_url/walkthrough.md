## Walkthrough
By looking at the Login button, you can see that it calls the submitLogin function in validation.js. This function does a POST request to <code>/v1/session</code> with the form's username and password. If the request returns a 201, it calls the getFlag method. This method does a GET request on <code>/v1/flag</code>. There is no validation done when doing the GET request, so you can run <code>curl ip_address/v1/flag</code> or navigate your browser to <code>/v1/flag</code> and you will see the flag.
